# Study objectives

-	Did the biomass of predators vary based on the latitudes of the sample locations? 
-	How does the feeding behaviour of the predators change their mass? Their length? 
-	Is there a correlation of predator mass and prey mass? 
-	What is the distribution of feeding behaviour strategies in the different latitudes of the locations sampled? 
-	Does change in depth and predators affect predator mass? Their length? 
-   What is the effect of specific habitat types on predator feeding behaviour?
